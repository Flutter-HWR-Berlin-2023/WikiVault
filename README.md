# WikiVault

WikiVault is a Flutter app that allows you to search, read and bookmark Wikipedia articles for offline use. It also keeps track of your search history, so you can easily find articles you've previously looked up. The app was built in the context of the HWR 2023 Flutter course to teach about the capabilities and use cases for Flutter. The project framework was provided by the university as an assignment.


## Features

- Search for Wikipedia articles
- Read articles offline
- Bookmark articles for later
- View your session's search history
- Interact with the Wikipedia API in JSON format
- Use Hive for offline storage
- Follow the Flutter architecture pattern using Blocs


## Getting Started

To get started with WikiVault, clone this repository and open it in Visual Studio Code or Android Studio. Then, run the app on an emulator or physical device.

```sh

```


## Usage

Once installed on your device, you can use WikiVault search to look up articles by typing in a query in the search bar. The app will display a list of articles that match your query. You can then tap on an article to read it, or bookmark it for later by tapping the bookmark icon. You can view your search history by tapping the history icon.
